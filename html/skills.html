                I use Css to style and place my html elements on my desired position.
                I also use it to conduct how each html element will behave on the page.
                With the combination of html, i created this website.
              </p>
            </div>
            <br>
            <div class="lnth">
              <h2 style="padding-bottom: 0px; height: 15px;">
                Time length of course:
              </h2>
              <br>
              <p style="padding-top:0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br>
                It took me approximately 2 month to learn Css.
                Because it was a very confusing language for me.
                But it all made sense later on.
                Also, my courses were <span style="color:goldenrod;" title="Something/Someone hard to understand">abstruse</span> because of rapid speaking.
